What I want to do here is create a queue system with rabbitmq. Each Pi will have a queue, and the flask web app will be able to submit jobs and track status of jobs. Each Pi will be an nmap scanner node. The web app will controll them through an ssh tunnel. 

The goal is to have some boxes to lay around networks and have them do scans that are easily controlled via a web app on a phone. This is so you don't have to leave your laptop on site to complete big nmap scans, and this give the added benefit of multiple nodes to obfuscate port scanning. 
 

(Pi[RabbitMQ queue client nmap])-|  		   [Flask Web Application] 	  
	                             |---Internet--[RabbitMQ Server]
	                             |-----/ 	
(Pi[RabbitMQ queue client nmap])-|----/ [ssh]
								 | 	 /									  	
(Pi[RabbitMQ queue client nmap])-|--/
